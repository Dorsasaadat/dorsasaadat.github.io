Summary : this is about 15-year-old Charlie, an endearing and naive outsider, coping with first love, the suicide of his best friend, and his own mental illness while struggling to find a group of people with whom he belongs.

Personal opinion : It worth reading this book once.The author did very well in explaining Charlie's feeling.You can understand him deeply especially if you at the same position.
