title: Mandelbrot Set
---
This term was a long journey and we ended it with a really strong and interesting project. Mandelbrot.
At first it was confusing and frustrating because i felt like i don't know anything but as the time went by it got much better and i started to understand what i was doing . 
I got the first outputs from python ⬇️:

but unfortunately i couldn't produce these in C.
I can say the most challenging part was setting color.But with the help of a few websites i reached a relatively good result.

outputs i got from C ⬇️:

with the help of friends and family i chose one.
The next part was generating hundreds of photos and converting them to a video which i can say wasn't that hard but the challenging part was to find the best points to zoom on . [this website](https://mandel.gart.nz/) helped me a lot.
